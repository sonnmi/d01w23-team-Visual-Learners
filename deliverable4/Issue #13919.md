#### **Acceptance Tests**:
*Scenario 1: User wants all the plots created to have major gridlines with a certain style*
1.  A user navigates to the `matplotlibrc` file after installing matplotlib library.
2.  A user locates `grid` related `rcParams` for major `grid`. (`grid.major.color`, `grid.major.linestyle`, `grid.major.linewidth`, `grid.major.alpha`)
3.  A user sets the value of `rcParams` to the desired value.
4.  A user creates a plot setting the major `grid` and major `tick` visible.
5.  A user displays the plot.
6.  A user accepts if the major `grid` follows set attributes in `rcParams`.

3.  A user sets the value of `rcParams` to the desired value.
4.  A user creates a plot setting the minor `grid` and minor `tick` visible.

3.  A user sets the value of `rcParams` to the desired value.
4.  A user creates a plot setting the both `grid` and both `tick` visible.
5.  A user displays the plot.
6.  A user accepts if both the major and minor `grid` follows set attributes in `rcParams`.

*Scenario 4: User wants most of the plots created to have major gridlines with a certain style but others to be set manually*
1.  A user navigates to the `matplotlibrc` file after installing matplotlib library.
2.  A user locates `grid` related `rcParams` for major `grid`. (`grid.major.color`, `grid.major.linestyle`, `grid.major.linewidth`, `grid.major.alpha`)
3.  A user sets the value of `rcParams` to the desired value for most of the plot.
4.  A user creates a plot setting the major `grid` and major `tick` visible.
5.  A user sets the attribute of the major `grid` for this plot manually.
6.  A user displays the plot.
7.  A user accepts if the major `grid` follows the manually set attributes.
