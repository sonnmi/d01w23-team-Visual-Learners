# [Issue 19409 - Boxplot Median Line](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/19409)

#### Implementation: 
As it is an issue within the `boxplot` class, we located the code assigning the default value for the `boxplot` and reassigned the `solid_capstyle` attribute of the median line to `butt` if the `linewidth` attribute is changed other than the default value.. 

#### How this implementation addressed the issue:
The median line we are trying to fix is a `2DLine` object.  Its default `solid_capstyle` attribute is set to `projecting`, which causes the length to change with width.  However, a `2DLine` object with the `solid_capstyle` attribute set to `butt` would not have this issue. Thus we chose to reassign the value of the `solid_capstyle` attribute for the median inside the `boxplot` class.  Keeping `solid_capstyle` attribute default to projecting such that unit tests come with matplotlib would be able to pass.

#### The changes that were made to the design/codebase of the chosen system:
We did not make any changes to the design of the chosen system, as we are only changing two default values in the boxplot class. There is nothing that changed with the architect. 

#### The files that were added/deleted/modified as a result of the implementation:
The code added is in file matplotlib-main/lib/matplotlib/axes/\_axes.py,  line 3956 to line 3961

#### Acceptance test:
The first test with the width of the median line changed:
1.  make a data set  
2.  create a `boxplot` with the dataset
3.  change the `linewidth` attribute of the `medianprop`
4.  display the `plot` created
5.  observe any malfunction of the median line displayed
6.  accept if displayed properly

The second test with default medianprop setting:
1.  make a data set
2.  create a `boxplot` with the dataset
3.  display the `plot` created
4.  observe any malfunction of the `median line` displayed
5.  accept if displayed properly
The third test with custom medianprop setting:
1.  make a data set
2.  create a boxplot with the dataset
3.  change the solid_capstyle attribute of the medianprop to projecting or round
4.  display the plot created
5.  observe any malfunction of the median line displayed
6.  accept if displayed properly
