# [Issue 22376 - Align Titles Issue](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/22376)

#### Implementation:
The implementation adds the feature of aligning titles of subplots in the same row automatically. Previously, as described in the Github issue, Matplotlib provided the capability of aligning labels but not aligning titles of subplot. With the implementation, Matplotlib provides the capability of aligning titles of subplots in the same row to the title with the largest y value in this row with `Figure.align_titles()`. Moreover, the alignment of titles persists for following draw events after this function has been called.

#### How The Issue Is Addressed:
1. Class variables `_align_title_group` was added to `Figure` to keep track of the `Axes`s of the titles we want to align, and `align_title` was added to keep track of if title alignment is activated. 
2. When `Figure.align_titles()` is called, our implementation adds the `Axes`s we want to align to  `_align_title_group`, default to all `Axes`s in the Figure.
3. When `Figure.show()` is called, `_AxesBase.draw()` is called.  `_AxesBase.draw()` then calls `_AxesBase._update_title_position()`. Our implementation adds comparison among the bounding boxes of `Axes` and `XAxis` respectively to `_AxesBase._update_title_position()` to adjust the y-coordinates of titles in `_align_title_group`.

Therefore, after all adjustments have been done in `_AxesBase._update_title_position()`, the titles owned by `Axes`s in `_align_title_group` are aligned to the highest title in the same row.

#### Changes to The Design/Codebase:
Two new class variables and function are added to `Figure`. There is no major change in design/codebase.

No other files were created or deleted in the process.

#### Issue 22376 User Acceptance Test
Steps:\
1. Create 2 by 2 subplots and set `wspace` and `hspace` to 0.5 to guarantee the subplots do not overlap.\
2. Set the position of the x label of subplot \[0]\[0] to “top”.\
3. Set the `title` of subplot \[0]\[0] to “test1” and the `title` of subplot \[0]\[1] to “test2”.\
4. Set the `_right_title` of subplot \[0]\[1] to “test3”.\
5. Set subplot \[1]\[0] to 5 rows and 3 columns and subplot \[1]\[1] to 3 columns and 5 rows.\
6. Set the `title` of subplot \[1]\[0] to “test4” and the `title` of subplot \[1]\[1] to “test5”.\
7. Call the function `align_titles()` to align all the `titles` and show the figure.

The user should get a figure like this, where all titles are aligned with other titles in the same row:

This test contains the use cases of:
* Two center titles in the same row
* A center title and a right title in the same row
* Two center titles for subplots with the same size but one x label is at the top
* Two center titles for subplots with different sizes
* Titles in more than one row

Sample code for above steps:
```python
# Step 1  
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, gridspec_kw = {'wspace':0.5, 'hspace':0.5})  

# Step 2  
axs[0][0].xaxis.set_ticks_position("top")  

# Step 3  
axs[0][0].set_xlabel('XLabel 0')  
axs[0][0].set_title('test1')  
axs[0][1].set_xlabel('XLabel 1')  
axs[0][1].set_title('test2')  

# Step 4  
axs[0][1].set_title('test3', loc='right')  

# Step 5-6  
axs[1][0].imshow(np.zeros((5, 3)))  
axs[1][0].set_title('test4')  
axs[1][1].imshow(np.zeros((3, 5)))  
axs[1][1].set_title('test5')  

# Step 7  
fig.align_titles()  
fig.show()
```
