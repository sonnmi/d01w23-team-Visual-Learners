# [Issue 19409 - Boxplot Median Line](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/19409)
Chenbo Wang (issue fix) | Yuehai Zhou (unit testing)
<br /><br />

## **Implementation**
The issue lies within the `boxplot` class, specifically the default values for `boxplot`. We reassigned the `solid_capstyle` attribute of the median line to `butt` if the `linewidth` attribute is changed other than the default value.

#### How this implementation addressed the issue:
The median line we are trying to fix is a 2DLine object. The default `solid_capstyle` attribute is `projecting`, which causes the length to change with width. However, a 2DLine object with the `solid_capstyle` attribute set to `butt` would not have this issue. So to ensure that the pre-existing unit tests will still pass, the default `solid_capstyle` attribute is `projecting` unless the width has changed, then the default `solid_capstyle` attribute is `butt`.

#### The changes that were made to the design/codebase of the chosen system:
We did not make any changes to the design of the chosen system, as we are only changing two default values in the boxplot class. There is nothing that changed with the architect. 

#### The files that were added/deleted/modified as a result of the implementation:
The code added is in file matplotlib-main/lib/matplotlib/axes/\_axes.py,  line 3956 to line 3961

## **Testing**

#### **Unit tests**
Unit tests can be found in ['']()

<br />

#### **Acceptance Tests**:
*Scenario 1: the width of the median line changed*
1.  make a data set  
2.  create a `boxplot` with the dataset
3.  change the `linewidth` attribute of the `medianprop`
4.  display the `plot` created
5.  observe any malfunction of the median line displayed
6.  accept if displayed properly

*Scenario 2: default medianprop setting*
1.  make a data set
2.  create a `boxplot` with the dataset
3.  display the `plot` created
4.  observe any malfunction of the `median line` displayed
5.  accept if displayed properly

*Scenario 3: custom medianprop setting*
1.  make a data set
2.  create a boxplot with the dataset
3.  change the solid_capstyle attribute of the medianprop to projecting or round
4.  display the plot created
5.  observe any malfunction of the median line displayed
6.  accept if displayed properly
