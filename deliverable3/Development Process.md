## Project Management Process
We use Jira to see everyone's progress. For deliverable 3, we need to fix/address three different issues. Therefore we created three user stories that corresponded to each issue.

Everyone went through Matplotlib's Issues tab scouring for a good "good first issue" / "difficulty: easy" issue. Once everyone had what issue they wanted to do, Hongkang Yu volunteered to work separately since we were a group of five having to split between three issues. The four of us were then randomly assigned into groups of two. From there, it was a discussion amongst each other about what issue each group will ultimately decide to do. After reading more about the issue, each group created subtasks to divide the work and added their estimations on Jira. The following three screenshots show each issue's subtasks:

#### Issue #22376 (Hongkang Yu)

#### Issue #23998 (Yesom Son & Lander Joshua Vitug)

#### Issue #19409 (Chenbo Wang & Yuehai Zhou)

Throughout the development process, we tracked our tasks by logging our hours on each subtask and adding comments whenever necessary. Here's an example highlighting task tracking and estimating:

## Communication Process
Early on, we decided to have consistent meetings every two days. Having the standup every other day gives us enough time to have significant updates during each standup. In addition, we also had meeting minutes to track previous action items and plan action items for our next meeting. By having these action items, we hold each other accountable and give time to set realistic goals. Our meeting minutes are on Github in `deliverable3/Meeting_Minutes`.

These standup meetings are not to say that we don't communicate as a group outside of these times. We still message and video call whenever necessary to get the work done, but this is harder to track compared to our standups.

## Github Process
During our first meeting on March 4, 2023, we agreed on employing git flow which organizes our Github repository into two main branches: `main` and `development`. Everyone will branch from `development` to implement their issues before merging back to the `development` branch. At the end of each deliverable, we then merge `development` into `main`. And as we agreed in the `Team Agreement` pdf back in deliverable 1, all pull requests must be approved by at least two other team members.
